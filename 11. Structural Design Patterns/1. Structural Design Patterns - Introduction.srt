1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,050
Or I'd support solutions on finishing up your first group of design parents you now have all the tools

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,340
that are needed to solve problems that are related to creating objects from glasses.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,190
Now it's time to jump to the next group in our design patterns study and that is the structural design

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:28,110
patterns so designers that belong to this group they deal with how we can arrange our classes and objects

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,160
in order to get some functionality or behavior are there.

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,810
So do we mean by that so we can use composition and we can use inheritance and when we combine these

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,010
two powerful features and create arrangements using these two features of object oriented programming

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,910
we can get some really interesting behavior out of our objects and classes and using these arrangements

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,860
we can solve some really common problems that we will face in your real life.

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:06,330
Devlopment So here is a list of design patterns that we are going to study here and these design problems

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,260
solves some very interesting problems.

12
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,450
For example let's say you want to provide a method level security to your objects so you want to make

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,740
sure that whoever is calling your object's method must have performed an art indication.

14
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:30,700
Let's say you want to use or simplify use of your subsystem so you have these multiple classes designed

15
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,780
that carry out complicated functionality.

16
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,240
But now it is becoming quite a tiresome or tedious for the client code to use all these classes.

17
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,270
So you can simplify your entire subsystem using a single plus.

18
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,960
So these are some of the examples of problems that design patterns in this group trying to solve.

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,940
All right.

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,970
So we're going to start with adapter and see you in the next one.
