1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,160
All right.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:07,790
So congratulations on finishing up the structural design patents and now we are onto our last group

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,930
of design veterans and that is behavioral design patents.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:20,340
So Design Patterns in this group they revolve around designing the interaction between objects and classes

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,500
and by designing these interactions in a certain way we can solve a multitude of problems.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,110
And I assure you that this is one of the most exciting group of design patterns and you will use most

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,350
of these design patterns almost regularly.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,520
So let's look at the list of design patterns.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,270
OK so this is a lot less but I assure you that you are probably already using most of these.

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,360
So chain of response with the this is the first one.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,810
If you have every word with servlet in Java then you have used chain of responsibility because all these

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,940
overlit filters follow this design.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,790
If you have worked with collections in Java then you have used with work with iterator greater design

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:11,210
Bahan observer and visiter are some of the most used patterns because they solve specific problems that

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,620
are very common.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,170
All right.

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,330
So let's start with chain of responsibility in the next video.
